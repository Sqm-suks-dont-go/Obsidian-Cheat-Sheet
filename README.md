## Internal File Linking

In Obsidian we can link files inside the computer file system to notes. This is useful when using programs like Matlab or Solidworks or applications that are needed for specific applications. 

The general structure: 

```
[Displayed Name](file:///****Destination Address Starts with C:*********)
```

If the address has a space lets say `/Obsidian Vault/` The address will stop at `Obsidian` to fix this replace with a `%20` the pixies will get recognized as a space and the address will get recognized till the end of the address. Should look like `/Obsidian%20Vault/`.
